# Student-Management-System-in-Java
This system is a Student Management System that allows storing, managing, and updating student records, including their ID, name, marks, and date of birth.  Uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, such as encapsulation (storing student data within a Student class) and composition (using a separate DOB class to store birth details).
